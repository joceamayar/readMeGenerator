## Project Description

This program is designed to automate the creation of a README file for a software project. It prompts users with a series of questions, allowing them to input project-related information such as the title, description, and licensing preferences. Once all the prompts are completed, the program generates a formatted README file with the user's input, including a table of contents and license badge. This streamlined process ensures that users can quickly and accurately generate comprehensive project documentation without missing any crucial details.
